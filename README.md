# Ho-Ho-calorie-tracker
## Inspiration
I have noticed how during the holidays people seem to loose track of what they are eating and eat more calories than what they are supposed to be consuming. So, I wanted to make a website using Velo by Wix that includes a chatbot feature and a calorie tracker along with mentioning the point of this website and recommendations.

## What it does
This is a website that has instructions, diet recommendations, a chatbot, and a calorie tracker so users are able to track how many calories they have consumed so far in the day.

## How we built it
I built the website using Velo by Wix, HTML, and Javascript.

## Challenges we ran into
I am used to creating websites using harcore HTML, CSS, and Javascript so it was originally not easy just making a website using wix. I also took quite some time figuring out how to make the calorie tracker but was eventually able to figure it out.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud that I was able to create a website using Wix which is an MLH sponser and make it accessable for other people to see. I am also proud that I was able to work on a chatbot and a calorie tracker for this website.

## What we learned
I learned how to create a calorie tracker and use Wix.

## What's next for Ho-Ho-Calorie Tracker
- Add more features.
- Twilio text sms.
